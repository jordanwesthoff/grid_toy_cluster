WHAT IS IT ?

PTOOLS is a set of simple parallel tools useful for 
a clusterd work environment.
This includes PSH a parallel SSH utility and PCP , a 
parallel SCP utility.

You should have a tar archive called ptools-1.1.0.tar.gz

It contains the following files;

Makefile (the makefile to build ptools)
README (this file)
psh.c (the psh source code)
pcp.c (the pcp source code)
pcp.1 (man page for pcp)
psh.1 (man page for psh)
LICENSE (The lesser GNU Public License)


HOW DO I INSTALL IT ?

You must be root to install ptools.

extract the tar file: tar-xzvf ptools-1.3.0.tar.gz <enter>

change to the ptools directory:  cd ptools-1.3.0 <enter> 

Execute the makefile by typing "make" at the command prompt.
then type "make install"

You will need to create a file with a list of nodes in /etc

/etc/nodelist

The nodelist is a simple list of hosts which allows ssh access 
to the host running ptools.  The nodelist may not contain whitespace 
characters. In particular, each line is to be terminated with a 
newline character only (NO SPACES IN, BEFORE, OR AFTER HOSTNAMES).
Hosta may be listed by name or by IP address.

Be sure the remote hosts allows ssh for the host using ptools.

HOW DO I USE IT ?

Read the man pages: man psh <enter>  or man pcp <enter>
